# Assignment-for-Evolutionary-and-Heuristic-Optimisation
This is a programming assignment (on Python) that implements 4 search algorithms (random search, hill-climber, iterated local search and evolutionary algorithm) to find the permutation with an objective function which minimises the sum of the distance between adjacent elements of the permutation.
